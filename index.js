Please determine whether the following text appears to be a programming error message or not:

<text>
${input}
</text>

Output your final Yes or No answer in JSON format with the key 'answer'

Focus on looking for key indicators that suggest the text is an error message, such as:

- Words like "error", "exception", "stack trace", "traceback", etc.

- Line numbers, file names, or function/method names

- Language that sounds like it is reporting a problem or issue

- Language that sounds like it is providing feedback

- Technical jargon related to coding/programming

If you don't see clear signs that it is an error message, assume it is not. Only answer "Yes" if you are quite confident it is an error message. 
If it is not a traditional error message, only answer "Yes" if it sounds like it is providing feedback as part of an automated grading system.

If <assignment> and <current_code> are empty, assume that they're not available. 
With the available context, follow the guidelines and respond with either the teacher written explanation or your own if it doesn't match any <generalized_errors>

If generating your own explanation, make sure it is not longer than 2-3 sentences, and double check that it does not suggest any fixes or solutions. 
The explanation should only describe the cause of the error. Do not tell the student whether or not it matches. Just provide the explanation in either case only.`
